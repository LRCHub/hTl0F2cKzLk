Chill out, transformers, born to meet the skies
Transformers, more than meet the eyes
T-Bone, go, go, Kurtis blow y'all
Gimme the bomb, I'm chillin'
Go through it, dance
Now the next little item that I wanna discuss
Is the body-suckin' rappers that must be smokin' dust
When you make the kinda records that diss females
Frontin' on a story when it's just a tall tale
To diss a female is a lowdown shame
But you suckers make the records 'cause you wanna get fame
All you radio cats, don't play that crap
Can't you see they're messin' up in all the name of the rap
Now all these years rappers worked so hard
To give rappin' a name and all you rappers a job
But now you peasy-head B-boys get me upset
When you diss around and cut and then you just defect
Don't forget LaToya and the real Roxanne
Can't you think of somethin' else, you know what I'm sayin'?
But all you MC's just keep on illin', that's okay, 'cause I'm chillin'
Transformers, dance, born to meet the skies
I'm chillin', gimme the bomb
Now wherever you go I just want you to know
That I'm runnin' the show at twenty below
So let me tell you what it takes 'cause the others fake
It must've been imitate but those are the breaks
I'm a Leo the Lion, the lion with desire
When I'm rappin' on the mic, I set the world on fire
Devastatin', motivatin', complicatin', perpatratin'
Rappers who want to be on top
Stop, can't you see me in trouble, bo? It's rockin' the spot, yeah
And don't you ever forget it, trooper, workin' all day
It's time for Superman just to give you a break
Along with a go-go band, yes, yes, y'all
Can't you understand? What's the name of this jam?
I'm chillin', get funky, to the bridge
Get ready for it, y'all, get ready, baby
Alright, y'all, alright, here we go, y'all
Here I go, here I go, y'all, say what?
I said dance, I'm chillin'

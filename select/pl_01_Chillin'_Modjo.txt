One night in a disco
Chillin' with my friends
Feelin' kinda low
I was sitting on a fence
Suddenly I saw her
Dancing on the scene
Just like in a dream
She would set my heart on fire
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
<♪>
Anyone could see
Her body meaning things
That look so good to me
Music got my head
Spinning all around
She got me in a trance
Just by the way she danced
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
<♪>
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
I feel so high
Dancing all night
You blow my mind
'Cos you're so fine
